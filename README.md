#VirtualPiano

The Virtual Piano project is an interactive and engaging application that transforms your computer keyboard into a musical instrument.

Each key from A to L on the second row of your keyboard is mapped to a unique musical note, creating an immersive and authentic piano-playing experience.Users can experience the joy of playing a virtual piano with corresponding sounds and visual feedback.
